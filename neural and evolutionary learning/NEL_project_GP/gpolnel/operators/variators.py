""" Variation operators "move" the candidate solutions across S
The module `gpol.variators` contains some relevant variation operators
(variators) used to "move" the candidate solutions across the solve
space in between the iterations. Given the fact this library supports
different types of iterative solve algorithms (ISAs), the module
contains a collection of variators suitable for every kind of ISA
implemented in this library.
